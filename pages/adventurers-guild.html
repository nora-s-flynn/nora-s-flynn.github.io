                    <p>Under the Functions tab in the calculator, you can find and change many things about how it behaves. If you have your own Desmos account, you can save your own version of the calculator that behaves just how you like it.</p>
                    <p>The calculator uses a variable m to determine where the boundaries that separate mission outcomes fall. This m is a complicated function of the input variables, which you're welcome to change.</p>
                    <h5>Strength Factors</h5>
                    <p>As it is now, there is an overall swing factor a that changes how easily the boundaries move. Increasing a will increase the overall swingyness of the system.</p>
                    <p>You can also change how much each individual effect changes the boundaries. There are the following strength factors:</p>
                    <ul class="inside-list">
                        <li>a - Overall strength factor affecting swingyness</li>
                        <li>a<sub>L</sub> - Strength factor for being over/underlevelled</li>
                        <li>a<sub>P</sub> - Strength factor for having appropriate classes</li>
                        <li>a<sub>N</sub> - Strength factor for having the right number</li>
                        <li>a<sub>R</sub> - Strength factor for having a good reputation</li>
                        <li>a<sub>O</sub> - Strength factor for ad-hoc DM adjustments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By increasing the associated strength factor, you can increase how sensitively the system depends on that variable or effect.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Boundary Functions</h5>
                    <p>There are 4 boundary functions that separate the different mission outcomes. Each evaluates to a number between 1 and 100:</p>
                    <ul class="inside-list">
                        <li>f<sub>A</sub> - Separates 'Critical Success' from 'Success'</li>
                        <li>f<sub>B</sub> - Separates 'Success' from 'Mixed'</li>
                        <li>f<sub>C</sub> - Separates 'Mixed' from 'Failure'</li>
                        <li>f<sub>D</sub> - Separates 'Failure' from 'Failure Requiring Intervention'</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Offsets</h5>
                    <p>Each boundary is determined by a tanh function that depends on m, and each is shifted by an amount specific to that boundary function, called the offset. m<sub>A</sub> is the offset for f<sub>A</sub> and so on. Changing these offsets moves boundaries closer together or further aparet, determining how much harder it is to get one mission outcome than another.</p>

                    <h5>Steepnesses</h5>
                    <p>Steepnesses, for example k<sub>A</sub>, change how slow or fast each boundary changes with respect to m. The steepness f<sub>A</sub> is set to 0.5 while the rest are set to 1. This is so that, as the players throw more and more advantages at a mission, 'Critical Success' doesn't come to dominate the odds as quickly as 'Success' does.</p>
                    <ul class="inside-list">
                        <li>Offsets (m), each outcome boundary is a separate tanh function, varying by offsetting each a given amount. Varying m moves boundaries closer together or further apart</li>
                        <li>Steepnesses (k), change how slow or fast the boundary changes with respect to m. Changing these can let one outcome grow faster or slower than the others.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Calibration</h5>
                    <p>The default values of the Boundary Variables are set to give reasonable results in the following test case:</p>
                    <ul class="inside-list">

                                <p class="mb-1">When an agent joins your guild, sort them into a group based on the classic four D&D classes:</p>

                                <p>These can easily be adapted for use with themed guilds. A thieves' guild might use Brute, Thief, Mage, Spy instead, and focus mostly on the Crime missions.</p>
                                <p>We use levels 1-5, which equate to about 2 class levels each. A level 5 agent cannot progress further from working for your guild.</p>

                                <p class="mb-1">Next, decide who will go on this mission. You may select as many as the mission asks for, as well as an extra one. If an agent is paid per mission, they may be busy with other work, see payment section.</p>
                                <p>For example, let's say you send:</p>
                                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Durkon, Level 4 Cleric</strong><br/><small>The most experienced of your guild, here to provide leadership to your underleveled team, paid per mission</small></li>

                                <p class="mb-1">The <strong>Team Suitability</strong> is given by matching the team to the example composition. Our example party has a Wizard and a Rogue, but no Fighter, so we have a Team Suitability of 2.</p>
                                <p class="mb-1">This mission takes place in Greysky City, and let's say the guild has a Reputation of -3 there. There are no extenuating factors affecting success, so the <strong>Situational Bonus</strong> is set to 0.</p>
                                <p>So we have the following input variables:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mission Level = 2</li>
                                    <li>Average Party Level = 2.25</li>
                                    <li>Suggested Number of Agents = 3</li>
                                    <li>Number of Agents Sent = 4</li>
                                    <li>Team Suitability = 2</li>
                                    <li>Guild Reputation = -3</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>We plug these numbers into <a href="#calculator">the calculator</a>. It uses complicated functions to return the D100 table for the mission outcome, determined by the following input variables:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mission Level - L<sub>M</sub></li>
